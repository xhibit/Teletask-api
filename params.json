  "body": "# Teletask-api\r\n\r\nAn open source java JSON REST API for Teletask domotics.\r\n\r\nIt is the purpose to generate a REST API for software developers or domotics enthusiasts, who are interested in generating their own control environment for the TELETASK domotics systems, so you can create your own user interface and connected solutions and services.\r\n\r\nIf you own a Teletask MICROS (note: not the latest MICROS+), you have access to the free DLL32 LIBRARY (TDS15132).  However, if you're a java programmer like myself, you don't want to use a windows dll :-)\r\nBought me a RS232 > LAN converter (TDS10118) so I could access my MICROS server through regular IP.\r\n\r\nStarted discussing the possibilities on the Teletask forum: http://www.teletask.be/forum/default.aspx?g=posts&t=195\r\n...and ended up programming a java interface based on IP Sockets, exposed by a basic JSON REST service.\r\n\r\nInitially only setting and getting RELAYS, MTRUPDOWN, GENMOOD, LOCMOOD, COND, FLAG is supported.\r\n\r\n### How this API works:\r\n\r\n- Your Teletask config is read from the tds-config.json file.  This file holds all info on your personal setup. An example config can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/xhibit/Teletask-api/blob/master/backend/config-json/src/main/resources/tds-config.json)\r\n- Once configured correctly, build the war file using maven.\r\n- Deploy to a java app server on a device on your local network, so it has access to your MICROS server.  I used a low power [Raspberry PI](http://www.raspberrypi.org)\r\n\r\n**UPDATE**: Added a basic HTML 5 GUI for access on a mobile device.  Fastest implementation proved to be jQuery Mobile.   Will be improved in the future, but for now I have a dynamical UI which suits it's purpose...\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Libraries / Technologies\r\n\r\n- Maven 3\r\n- JBoss RESTEasy\r\n- Jackson JSON processor\r\n- jQuery Mobile\r\n- ...\r\n\r\n### REST API\r\n\r\nBase URL API\r\n`http://<host>:<port>/teletask/api`\r\n\r\n**Config**\r\n- URI: GET `<base_url>/component/config`\r\n  - Description: Gets the complete configuration in JSON.\r\n\r\n**Relay**\r\n\r\n- URI: GET `<base_url>/component/state/relay/{number}`\r\n  - Description: Gets the relay state.  Returns 0 for off, 1 for on.\r\n- URI: PUT `<base_url>/component/relay/{number}/state/{on/off}`\r\n  - Description: Switches the relay on/off.   \r\n\r\n**Local Mood**\r\n\r\n- URI: GET `<base_url>/component/state/mood/local/{number}`\r\n  - Description: Gets the mood state.  Returns 0 for off, 1 for on.\r\n- URI: PUT `<base_url>/mood/local/{number}/state/{on/off}`\r\n  - Description: Switches the mood on/off.  \r\n\r\n**General Mood**\r\n\r\n- URI: GET `<base_url>/component/state/mood/general/{number}`\r\n - Description: Gets the mood state.  Returns 0 for off, 1 for on.\r\n- URI: PUT `<base_url>/mood/general/{number}/state/{on/off}`\r\n - Description: Switches the mood on/off.  \r\n\r\n\r\n**Motor**\r\n\r\n- URI: GET `<base_url>/component/state/motor/{number}`\r\n  - Description: Gets the motor state.  1 for down, 0 for up.\r\n- URI: PUT `<base_url>/motor/{number}/state/{down/up}`\r\n  - Description: Switches the motor up or down. \r\n### Roadmap:\r\n\r\nCurrent status: fully working REST API & UI.\r\n\r\nFuture release:\r\n\r\n- Support all micros features (dimming, check flags, conditions...)\r\n- Add iBeacon support: this way I can use presence detection and switch relays depending on being close to a beacon.\r\n- Add support for an [iTach Flex](http://www.globalcache.com/products/itachflex/) device so I can control additional devices through IR (airco units, projector, tv, ....\r\n- A more advanced HTML 5 GUI for access on a mobile device (possibly using Twitter Bootstrap, Sencha Touch, ...).\r\n\r\n",
